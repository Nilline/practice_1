							<p class="block-online-tech__paragraph">
								By ordering the Products and/or accepting delivery of the Products from Shop, the Customer
								agrees
								that
								it is bound by these Terms and Conditions of sale. Customer orders, including orders placed via
								the
								internet, are subject to acceptance by Shop. The acceptance of the Customer's order by Shop is
								expressly made conditional upon the Customer's assent to these Terms and Conditions which will
								prevail
								notwithstanding anything that may be stated to the contrary on the Customer's order. Shop
								reserves
								the
								right to vary any of these terms at any time and any subsequent orders placed by the Customer
								will
								constitute an acceptance of the terms as varied. Once a Customer order has been placed and
								accepted
								by
								Shop, the Customer agrees that the Customer has no right to cancel or vary the order at any
								time,
								unless agreed upon in writing by both parties.

								placement, provided that the Products are accepted for delivery within a reasonable time. Prices
								are
								subject to change without notice. Recommended retail prices are provided for indicative purposes
								only

								account any variation in the total quantity purchased by the Customer. Prices include GST, but

							<p class="block-online-tech__paragraph">
								Credit Card Payments may attract a surcharge, and Shop will inform the Customer if this is to be
								the
								case before processing the transaction.
							</p>
							<p class="block-online-tech__paragraph">
								Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Shop, where Shop has not agreed in writing to provide
								commercial
								credit to the Customer, the total purchase price for Products supplied will be due for payment
								in
								cash
								prior to delivery.
							</p>
							<p class="block-online-tech__paragraph">
								Where Shop has agreed in writing to provide commercial credit to the Customer, the Customer must
								make
								payments in accordance with the payment terms provided by Shop.
							</p>
							<p class="block-online-tech__paragraph">
								Where Shop has approved the provision of a commercial credit arrangement with the Customer but
								has
								not

								price
								for Products supplied within seven days of the statement date.

								Change of Ownership
							</div>
							<p class="block-online-tech__paragraph">
								Trading accounts are approved by Shop based on the information supplied and the representations
								made
								by the Customer. In the event that there is a change in ownership of the Customer, whether total
								or
								partial, the Customer must immediately provide written notice to Shop informing Shop of these
								changes.
								Until Shop receives written notice from the Customer of a change in ownership, the Customer
								(including
								where it is a company or trustee, each of the Directors thereof) holds Shop indemnified against
								any
								and all losses, unpaid accounts, interest, damages, costs, charges, fees and expenses incurred
								or
								suffered by Shop in trading with any person, company (including the same company but with a
								different
								shareholder or shareholders) or other entity (including a trust) which may have purchased the
								Customer's business or any interest in the Customer's business or any of the shares in the
								Customer
								and used the Customer's previously approved account for trading.
							</p>
							<p class="block-online-tech__paragraph">
								Where a Customer has been authorised by Shop to make payments through Credit Card Direct Debit,
								the
								Customer must provide notice in writing at least five (5) days prior to any change in ownership
								of
								the
								business to allow Shop sufficient time to contact the new owner to obtain and confirm new Credit
								Card
								information if applicable.

								are
								intended to be merely a general description of the goods, are not incorporated within this
								agreement

							<div class="block-online-tech__title">
								Delivery
							</div>
							<p class="block-online-tech__paragraph">
								The means of delivering the Products to the Customer will be at Shop' discretion. Shop reserves
								the
								right to deliver Products in part deliveries. In the event that Shop incurs additional costs for
								meeting special (i.e. Tasmania / Northern Territory Deliveries) or urgent delivery arrangements,
								these
								additional costs may be charged to the Customer and may include the cost of airfreight where it
								is
								not
								the normal method of delivery. The Customer agrees to accept delivery of the Products sold at
								any
								time
								during normal business hours.
							</p>
							<p class="block-online-tech__paragraph">
								Shop will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any late delivery of the Products
								and
								late delivery will not entitle the Customer to rescind or repudiate the Customer's order for the
								Products.
